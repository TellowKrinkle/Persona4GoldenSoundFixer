# P4G Sound Fixer

Helper library to patch Persona 4 Golden to fix audio issues (where audio plays in cutscenes but not elsewhere)

See [this steam community page for details on the issue](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1113000/discussions/0/2441462389164687905/)

I have no clue if it works on any computer other than my own...
